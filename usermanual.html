        Zane Dayton And How I Work

        •	What is your style?
        Style like how I dress? I like to dress in tight jeans and big hoodies. I like adidas for shoes but have recently been getting into converse just for a change of pace.
        •	When do you like people to approach you and how?
        I really like when people approach it in a friendly way. Smiling and talkative. I tend to be rather quiet when I meet new people but once I warm up to them, I get talkative but when there are those award silences, I don’t really like that.
        •	What do you value?
        Knowledge and being a nice person. When you are a smart person, I feel like you have more value. If you are a kind and humble person as well, I value you as well. You are a nice person to have around. 
        •	How do you like people to communicate with you?
        In a casual way. I am not a fan of the super business or formal talk. Just let me know what you need from me and when so be precise because I don’t like doing more than what is asked of me.
        •	How do you make decisions?
        I think through them and then once I feel like I have a good idea of what each dissection holds I will choose the one I think is best.  Most of the time this decision making takes a long time, so I think about it a lot. I have usually think about it until the last minute right up to the decision making time. 
        •	How can people help you?
        I do have a hard time asking for help because I feel like I ask easy questions that I should know the answers to but don’t. Sometimes I need a refresher when it comes to what I’m working on. Ill ask a lot of questions but its ok if you don’t know all the answers just tell me to google it its alright. 
        •	What will you not tolerate in others?
        If you come to just chat with me while I’m trying to focus. I don’t mind talking to you any other place but if I’m trying to focus or do my own thing and you come in and start pestering me ill be quiet and avoid you.
